Professional Journey
During my time as the Online Sales Manager at Delight Hotels Pvt. Ltd. (April 2023 - September 2023), I honed skills in online portal management, effective communication, and competitive analysis. While this role may seem unrelated, the experience taught me the importance of user engagement and delivering personalized solutions â€” valuable lessons I now apply to my frontend development projects.

Coding Adventures
From personal portfolio websites to e-commerce designs and popular platform clones, I've delved into a variety of projects that showcase my passion for coding and creativity.

Beyond the Screen
Outside the tech world, I'm a tech enthusiast exploring the latest innovations and a guitar enthusiast finding inspiration in musical creativity.
